If we have a requirement to show the gradual changes in the CSS properties of an element during an interval of time.
For example, you might want to show an element changing its size in an interval of 2 seconds upon hover of the mouse. We can use the CSS3 transition property.

Transitions are used for moving the element from one state to another state by transiting the CSS properties of an element over a period of time.
We can mention the initial state and final state with transitions and it happens when some event occurs.
Observe how the movement of the rocket can be transited during a time interval on a webpage.

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept for understanding how elements are rendered and laid out on a webpage. It describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements and consists of several layers. Here’s a breakdown:

    Content Box: This is where your content (text, images, etc.) is displayed. 
            Its dimensions are controlled by the width and height properties.
    Padding Box: Padding is the space between the content and the border. It creates space inside the element’s border. 
            You can set padding using padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties.
    Border Box: This surrounds the padding (if any) and content. You can set the border’s width, style, and color using border-width, border-style, and border-color. 
            Borders can be applied on all sides or individually.
    Margin Box: The margin is the outermost space around the element, creating distance between it and other elements. 
            You can set margins using margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.
